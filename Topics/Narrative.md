Abstract:

Introduction
  short descriptions with high-level motivating examples of the different parts just frame the
  paper. Differentiating the audience and purpose that each section addresses - very high-level. 
  <!-- (End user, clean up
  own script, other people's script, better R code, validation (more informative of findGlobals()), efficiency, validation.)-->
   
  Then outline what each section will do
  
  In each section more detailed motivation.

1. End-user: 
 1. cleaning up own scripts, 
   What are some of the issues that arise as a script evolves - with one author?  or with multiple  authors?  (does this actually happen for most people)
   discarding expressions that aren't needed
   rm() variables
 understanding other people's scripts
   Finding the entry points
   Finding the input files and output files & WHY?


   codetools - make more correct.
   
Improve idioms
       for loops
	   
Performance:	   
   find which columns to read.
   parallelism


Future Work
 Code coverage, compilation
